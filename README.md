# AnimalMagic
This is a coding test project following an interview.
The company name has not been mentioned to reduce the chance of others searching for the company and using this solution as their submission.

As this is an interview code project test, I am unable to accept any pull requests, and would advise people not to comment on any of the code. This is project is to test my programming ability.

Written in ASP.NET Core (C#) using Visual Studio for Mac.

Uses node-sass for sass file compilation after build. Requires Node.js

## Future enhancements
- Animal collection is cached as an ICollection for a day. For more persistant storage, EntityFramework InMemory DbContext has been added but not implemented. The InMemory Database would be better
swapped out for a real database instance. By developing on a Mac, SQL Server isn't available, except via Docker, which may be beyond this code test.

- Add images

- Swap onomatopoeic descriptions of sounds to actual sound recordings
